Active Directory Home Lab Integrating PowerShell Project 

Objective 
Active Directory in my opinion is one of the most crucial project to learn. Since it is quite literally used in over 90% of Fortune 1000 companies all over the United States. Being able to learn and master Active Directory would be expanding your knowledge and will give you an advantage compared to someone else that hasnâ€™t worked on a project of this sort. To take advantage I have decided to take some time to learn more about active directory, and fully immerse myself into the world of IT. Always having that learning and building mindset in order for me to prepare me for a future job!
